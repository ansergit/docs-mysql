title: Backing Up and Restoring On-Demand MySQL for PCF
owner: MySQL
---

This topic describes how to configure automated backups for MySQL for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF),
and how to manually restore a MySQL service instance from a backup.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> As of v2.2.0, the MySQL for PCF tile no longer includes the option to disable automated backups. You must configure automated backups.</p>

## <a id="overview"></a>About Automated Backups

Automated backups do the following:

- Periodically create and upload backups suitable for restoring all of the databases used by the service instance.
- Operate without locking apps out of the database; no downtime.
- Include a metadata file that contains the critical details of the backup, including the calendar time of the backup.
- Encrypt backups within the MySQL for PCF VM; unencrypted data is never transported outside the MySQL for PCF deployment.

### <a id="understanding-metadata"></a> Backup Files and Metadata

When MySQL for PCF runs a backup, it uploads two files with Unix epoch-timestamped filenames of the form `mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP`:

  * The encrypted data backup file `mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP.tar.gpg`
  * A metadata file `mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP.txt`

The metadata file contains information about the backup and looks like this:

```
ibbackup_version = 2.4.5
end_time = 2017-04-24 21:00:03
lock_time = 0
binlog_pos =
incremental = N
encrypted = N
server_version = 5.7.16-10-log
start_time = 2017-04-24 21:00:00
tool_command = --user=admin --password=... --stream=tar tmp/
innodb_from_lsn = 0
innodb_to_lsn = 2491844
format = tar
compact = N
name =
tool_name = innobackupex
partial = N
compressed = N
uuid = fd13cf26-2930-11e7-871e-42010a000807
tool_version = 2.4.5
```

Within this file, the most important items are the `start_time` and the `server_version` entries.

The backup process does not interrupt MySQL service, but backups only reflect transactions that completed before their `start_time`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Although both <code>compressed</code> and <code>encrypted</code> show as <code>N</code> in this file,
the backup uploaded by MySQL for PCF is both compressed and encrypted. This is a known issue.</p>

### <a id="enable-backups"></a> About Configuring Automated Backups

MySQL for PCF automatically backs up databases to external storage.

* **How and where**---There are four options for how automated backups transfer backup data and where the data saves to:
  - [Option 1: Back up with SCP](#scp)---MySQL for PCF runs an SCP command that secure-copies backups to a VM
    or physical machine operating outside of PCF.
    SCP stands for secure copy protocol, and offers a way to securely transfer files between two hosts.
    The operator provisions the backup machine separately from their PCF installation.
    This is the fastest option.
  - [Option 2: Back up to Ceph or S3](#ceph-or-s3)---MySQL for PCF runs an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/) client
    that saves backups to an S3 bucket,
    a [Ceph](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/) storage cluster, or another S3-compatible endpoint certified by Pivotal.
  - [Option 3: Back up to GCS](#gcs)---MySQL for PCF runs an [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) SDK
    that saves backups to an Google Cloud Storage bucket.
  - [Option 4: Back up to Azure Storage](#azure)---MySQL for PCF runs an [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/)
    SDK that saves backups to an Azure storage account.

* **When**---Backups follow a schedule that you specify with a [cron](http://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) expression.

* **What is backed up**---Each MySQL instance backs up its entire MySQL data directory, consistent to a specific point in time.

To configure automated backups, follow the procedures below according to the option you choose for external storage.

## <a id="scp"></a> Option 1: Back Up with SCP

SCP enables the operator to use any desired storage solution on the destination VM.

To back up your database using SCP, complete the following procedures:

+ [Create a Public and Private Key Pair](#scp-keys)
+ [Configure Backups in Ops Manager](#configure-scp)

### <a id="scp-keys"></a> Create a Public and Private Key Pair

MySQL for PCF accesses a remote host as a user with a private key for authentication.
Pivotal recommends that this user and key pair be solely for MySQL for PCF.

1. Determine the remote host that you will be using to store backups for MySQL for PCF.
   Ensure that the MySQL service instances can access the remote host.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends using a VM outside the PCF deployment for the destination of SCP backups.
       As a result you might need to enable public IPs for the MySQL VMs. </p>

1. (Recommended) Create a new user for MySQL for PCF on the destination VM.

1. (Recommended) Create a new public and private key pair for authenticating as the above user on the destination VM.

### <a id="configure-scp"></a> Configure Backups in Ops Manager

Use Ops Manager to configure MySQL for PCF to backup using SCP.

1. In Ops Manager, open the MySQL for PCF tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select **SCP**.
    ![SCP Backup Configuration Form](scp-backups.png)

1. Fill in the fields as follows:<br><br>
    * **Username**---Enter the user that you created above.
    * **Private Key**---Enter the private key that you created above.
        The public key should be stored for ssh and scp access on the destination VM.
    * **Hostname**---Enter the IP or DNS entry that should be used to access the destination VM.
    * **Destination Directory**---Enter the directory in which MySQL for PCF should upload backups.
    * **Cron Schedule**---Enter a `cron` schedule, using standard [cron syntax](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto),
        to take backups of each service instance.
    * **Fingerprint**---Enter the fingerprint of the destination VM's public key.
        This helps to detect any changes to the destination VM.
    * **Enable Email Alerts**---Select to receive email notifications when a backup failure occurs.
          Also verify that you have done the following:
          - Added all users who need to be notified about failed backups to System org and System space</li>
          - Configured Email Notifications in Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime,
          see <em>Configure Email Notifications</em> for your IaaS:
           <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#smtp">AWS</a>,
           <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/azure-er-config.html#smtp">Azure</a>,

           <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/config-er-vmware.html#smtp">vSphere</a>.

## <a id="ceph-or-s3"></a> Option 2: Back Up to Ceph or S3

To back up your database on Ceph or Amazon S3, complete the following procedures:

+ [Create a Policy and Access Key](#access-key-aws)
+ [Configure Backups in Ops Manager](#configure-aws)

### <a id="access-key-aws"></a> Create a Policy and Access Key

MySQL for PCF accesses your S3 store through a user account.
Pivotal recommends that this account be solely for MySQL for PCF.
You must apply a minimal policy that lets the user account upload backups to your S3 store.

1. Create a policy for your MySQL for PCF user account. 

    <br>Policy creation varies depending on the S3 provider.
        Follow the relevant procedure to give MySQL for PCF the following permissions:<br><br>
      * List and upload to buckets
      * (Optional) Create buckets in order to use buckets that do not already exist  

    For example, in AWS, to create a new custom policy, go to **IAM** > **Policies** > **Create Policy** > **Create Your Own Policy**
    and paste in the following permissions:  
     <pre class="highlight json">
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ServiceBackupPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::MY\_BUCKET\_NAME/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::MY\_BUCKET\_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

1. (Recommended) Create a new user for MySQL for PCF and record its Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, the user credentials.

1. Attach the policy you created to the AWS user account that MySQL for PCF will use to access S3 (**IAM** > **Policies** > **Policy Actions** > **Attach**).

### <a id="configure-aws"></a> Configure Backups in Ops Manager

Use Ops Manager to connect MySQL for PCF to your S3 account.

1. In Ops Manager, open the MySQL for PCF tile **Backups** pane.

1. Select **Ceph or Amazon S3**.  
    ![S3 Backup Configuration Form](S3-backups.png)

1. Fill in the fields as follows:<br><br>
      * **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**---Enter the S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from above.
      * **Endpoint URL**---Enter the S3 compatible endpoint URL for uploading backups.
          URL must start with `http://` or `https://`.
          The default is https://s3.amazonaws.com
      * **Region**---Enter the region where your bucket is located or the region where you want a bucket to be created.
        If the bucket does not already exist, it is created automatically.
      * **Bucket Name**---Enter the name of your bucket. 
      Do not include an `s3://` prefix, a trailing `/`, or underscores. 
      Pivotal recommends using the naming convention `DEPLOYMENT-backups`, such as `sandbox-backups`.
      * **Bucket Path**---Enter the path in the bucket to store backups. 
      Do not include a trailing `/`. Pivotal recommends using `mysql-v2`.
      * **Cron Schedule**---Enter a `cron` schedule, using standard [cron syntax](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto),
          to take backups of each service instance.
      * **Enable Email Alerts**---Select to receive email notifications when a backup failure occurs.
          Also verify that you done the following:
          * Added all users who need to be notified about failed backups to System org and System space</li>
          * Configured Email Notifications in PAS (or Elastic Runtime),

+ [Create a Policy and Access Key](#access-key)
+ [Configure Backups in Ops Manager](#configure-gcs)

### <a id="access-key"></a> Create a Policy and Access Key

MySQL for PCF accesses your GCS store through a service account.
Pivotal recommends that this account be solely for MySQL for PCF.
You must apply a minimal policy that lets the user account upload backups to your GCS store.

1. In the GCS console, create a new service account for MySQL for PCF: **IAM and Admin** > **Service Accounts** > **Create Service Account**.<br><br>

      MySQL for PCF needs the following permissions for this account:
      * List and upload to buckets
      * (Optional) Create buckets in order to use buckets that do not already exist  


1. Enter a unique name in the **Service account name** field, such as `MySQL-for-PCF`.

1. In the **Roles** dropdown, grant the `MySQL-for-PCF` service account the **Storage Admin** role.

1. Check the **Furnish a new private key** box so that a new key is created and downloaded.

1. Click **Create** and take note of the name and location of the service account JSON file that is downloaded.

## <a id="manual-backup"></a> Manual Backup

MySQL for PCF v2.3 disables remote admin access to MySQL databases.
To access your MySQL database to perform a manual backup, you must create a service key for each service instance you want to back up.

This backup acquires a global read lock on all tables, but does not hold it for the entire duration of the dump.

Perform the following steps to back up your MySQL for PCF data manually:

1. Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to target the Cloud Controller of your PCF deployment with `cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
   For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf api api.sys.cf-example.com</pre>
  For more information about installing and using the cf CLI, see the [cf CLI documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/index.html).

1. Log in:
  <pre class="terminal">$ cf login</pre>

1. Create a service key for the MySQL service instance. Run the following command:
    `cf create-service-key SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME SERVICE_KEY_NAME -c '{"read-only":true}'`
    <br><br>
    Where:<br>
    * `SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME`: Enter the name of the existing MySQL service instance that contains the data you want to back up.  
    * `SERVICE_KEY_NAME`: Choose a name for the new service key.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-service-key mysql-spring spring-key \
    -c '{"read-only":true}'
    Creating service key spring-key for service instance mysql-spring as admin...
    OK
    </pre>

1. After creating the service key, retrieve its information. Run the following command:
  `cf service-key SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME SERVICE-KEY-NAME`
    <br><br>
    Where:<br>
    * `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`: Enter the name of the MySQL service instance you created a service key for.
    * `SERVICE-KEY-NAME`: Enter the name of the newly created service key.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf service-key mysql-spring spring-key
    Getting key spring-key for service instance mysql-spring as admin...

    {
     "hostname": "10.10.10.5",
     "jdbcUrl": "jdbc:mysql://10.10.10.5:3306/cf\_e2d148a8\_1baa\_4961\_b314_2431f57037e5?user=abcdefghijklm\u0026password=123456789",
     "name": "cf\_e2d148a8\_1baa\_4961\_b314\_2431f57037e5",
     "password": "123456789",
     "port": 3306,
     "uri": "mysql://abcdefghijklm:123456789<span>@</span>10.10.10.5:3306/cf\_e2d148a8\_1baa\_4961\_b314\_2431f57037e5?reconnect=true",
     "username": "abcdefghijklm"
    }
    </pre>

1. Examine the output and record the following values:
    * `hostname`: The MySQL for PCF proxy IP address
    * `password`: The password for the user that can be used to perform backups of the service instance database
    * `username`: The username for the user that can be used to perform backups of the service instance database

1. Use [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html) to back up the data for your service instance.
   Run the following command:
    `mysqldump -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -h MYSQL-IP --all-databases --single-transaction > BACKUP-NAME.sql`
    <br><br>
    Where:<br>
    * `USERNAME`: Enter the username retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `PASSWORD`: Enter the password retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `MYSQL-IP`: Enter the value of `hostname` retrieved from the output of `cf service-key`.
    * `BACKUP-NAME`: Enter a name for the backup file.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ mysqldump -u abcdefghijklm \
    -p 123456789 \
    -h 10.10.10.8 \
    --all-databases \
    --single-transaction > spring-db-backup.sql</pre>

## <a id="restore"></a> Restore a Service Instance from Backup

Restoring MySQL for PCF from backup is a manual process primarily intended for disaster recovery.
Restoring a MySQL for PCF service instance replaces all of its data and running state.

To restore a MySQL for PCF instance from an offsite backup, download the backup and restore to a new instance by following these procedures:

+ [Retrieve Backup Encryption Key](#retrieve-key)
+ [Download the Backup Artifact](#download)
+ [Restore the Service Instance](#restoreinstance)

###<a id="retrieve-key"></a> Retrieve Backup Encryption Key

Perform the following steps to retrieve the backup encryption key:

<ol>
<li>Run <code>cf service</code> to determine the GUID associated with the service instance that you want to restore:
 <pre class="terminal">$ cf service MY-INSTANCE-NAME --guid \
 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef</pre>
</li>
<li>Perform the steps in <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather">Gather Credential and IP Address Information</a> and <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh">SSH into Ops Manager</a> of <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI to SSH into the Ops Manager VM</em>.</li>
<li>From the Ops Manager VM, log in to your BOSH Director with the BOSH CLI. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in">Log in to the BOSH Director</a> in <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</em>.</li>
<li> Perform the steps in <a href="prepare-tls.html#uaa">Create UAA Client</a>.</li>
<li> If you are using PCF v1.12, perform the steps in <a href="prepare-tls.html#credhub-cli">Download the CredHub CLI (PCF v1.12 Only)</a> to download the CredHub CLI on the Ops Manager VM.</li>
<li>Set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your BOSH CredHub server.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:
    <pre><code>credhub api https://BOSH-DIRECTOR:8844 \
    --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</code></pre>
    <br>
    Where <code>BOSH-DIRECTOR</code> is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM. 
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ credhub api http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 \
    --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate</pre>
</li>
<li> Log in to BOSH CredHub.
    <br><br>
    Run the following command:
    <pre><code>credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=CLIENT-SECRET</code></pre>
    <br>
    Where <code>CLIENT-SECRET</code> is the client secret you set in step 9 of <a href="prepare-tls.html#uaa">Create UAA Client</a>.
    <br><br>
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789</pre>
</li>
<li> Use the CredHub CLI to retrieve the backup encryption key.
  Run the following command:
  <pre><code>credhub get \
  -n /p-bosh/service-instance_GUID/backup_encryption_key</code></pre> 
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ credhub get \
  -n /p-bosh/service-instance_70d30bb6-7f30-441a-a87c-05a5e4afff26/backup_encryption_key</pre>
  Examine the output and copy the backup encryption key under <code>value</code>. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">id: d6e5bd10-3b60-4a1a-9e01-c76da688b847
  name: /p-bosh/service-instance_70d30bb6-7f30-441a-a87c-05a5e4afff26/backup_encryption_key
  type: password
  value: UMF2DXsqNPPlCNWMdVMcNv7RC3Wi10
  version_created_at: 2018-04-02T23:16:09Z</pre>
</li>
</ol>

###<a id="download"></a> Download the Backup Artifact

Download the backup artifact from your blob storage.

These instructions assume that you are using AWS S3 as your backup destination.
If you are using a different backup destination, see the documentation for your backup provider to download the backup.

Perform the following steps to download the backup artifact from an AWS S3 bucket:

1. From the Ops Manager VM, download the manifest for the service instance deployment by specifying the deployment name as `service-instance_GUID` and a filename for the manifest. 
For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
   $ bosh2 -e my-env \
   -d service-instance_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef \
   manifest > ./manifest.yml
  </pre>

4. Inspect the downloaded manifest and record the following properties:<br><br>
  * `properties.service-backup.destinations[0].config.bucket_name`: This is the bucket where the backups are uploaded.
  * `properties.service-backup.destinations[0].config.bucket_path`: This is the path within the bucket above.

5. Log in to the AWS CLI.
   For information about how to download and use the AWS CLI, see [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

6. List the available backups for the instance, replacing `BUCKET-NAME` and `BUCKET-PATH` with values from above.
  The artifacts are sorted by time. 
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ aws s3 ls \
  --recursive s3://BUCKET-NAME/BUCKET-PATH/service-instance\_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef/
 </pre>

7. Choose the most recent backup file, or an older backup you want to restore from. The backups are timestamped in the filename and have a `.gpg` extension.

8. Download the selected backup:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ aws s3 cp \
  s3://BUCKET-NAME/BUCKET-PATH/service-instance\_12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef/YEAR/MONTH/DATE/mysql-backup-1489168980-0.tar.gpg \
  ./a-local-path/mysql-backup-1489168980-0.tar.gpg
 </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also log in to AWS and download S3 backups from a browser.</p>

###<a id="restoreinstance"></a> Restore the Service Instance

Because restoring a service instance is destructive, Pivotal recommends that you restore to a new and unused service instance. 

These instructions assume you have a backup downloaded. 

To restore the backup to a new service instance, follow these procedures:

* [Create and Prepare a New Service Instance for Restore](#prepare)<br>
* [Run the Restore Utility](#runrestore)

#### <a id="prepare"></a> Create and Prepare a New Service Instance for Restore

1. Determine the service plan associated with the old service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service OLD-INSTANCE-NAME
 </pre>

1. [Create a new service instance](./use.html#create) using the same service plan to restore to:
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf create-service p.mysql db-small NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Monitor the status of the service instance creation; it may take several minutes as the VM is created.
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Determine the GUID associated with your service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf service NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE --guid
 </pre>

1. Perform the steps in [Retrieve Admin and Read-Only Admin Credentials for a Service Instance](troubleshoot.html#instance-creds) to retrieve the admin password for your service instance.

1. From the Ops Manager VM, find and record the MySQL instance name and GUID from BOSH:
   <pre class="terminal">
   $ bosh2 -e my-env -d my-dep instances
   </pre>

1. Copy the downloaded backup to the new service instance:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh2 -e my-env \
  -d my-dep scp mysql-backup-TIMESTAMP.tar.gpg BOSH-INSTANCE:DESTINATION-PATH
  </pre>
  - BOSH-INSTANCE is `mysql/INSTANCE-GUID`. For example, `mysql/d7ff8d46-c3e8-449f-aea7-5a05b0a1929c`.
  - DESTINATION-PATH is where the backup file saves on the BOSH VM. For example, `/tmp/`.

1. Use the BOSH CLI to SSH in to the newly created MySQL service instance. For more information, see [BOSH SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh). 

1. After securely logging in to MySQL, run `sudo su` to become root:
 <pre class="terminal">
    $ sudo su
 </pre>

#### <a id="runrestore"></a> Run the Restore Utility

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: This is a destructive action and should only be run on a new and unused service instance.</p>

1. Run the restore utility to restore the backup artifact into the data directory. This process:<br><br> 
    * Deletes any existing data
    * Decrypts and untars the backup artifact
    * Restores the backup artifact into the MySQL data directory
 <pre class="terminal">
  $ mysql-restore --encryption-key ENCRYPTION-KEY \
  --mysql-username admin --mysql-password ADMIN-PASSWORD --restore-file RESTORE-FILE-PATH
 </pre>
  where:<br><br>
  * `ENCRYPTION-KEY` is the backup encryption key you retrieved in [Retrieve Backup Encryption Key](#retrieve-key).
  * `ADMIN-PASSWORD` is the admin password for your service instance retrieved in [Create and Prepare a New Service Instance for Restore](#prepare).
  * `RESTORE-FILE-PATH` is the full path on the MySQL VM where the backup artifact exists.

1. Exit the MySQL VM.

1. Determine if the app is currently bound to a MySQL service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf services
 </pre>

1. If the previous step shows that the app is currently bound to a MySQL instance, unbind it:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf unbind-service MY-APP OLD-SERVICE-INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Update your CF app to bind to the new service instance:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf bind-service MY-APP  NEW-SERVICE-INSTANCE
 </pre>

1. Restage your CF app to make the changes take effect:
 <pre class="terminal">
   $ cf restage MY-APP 
 </pre>

Your app should be running and able to access the restored data.
